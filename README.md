# Portfolio with React

## Description

The purpose of the project is to create a Portfolio page showcasing my work and experience. The webpage should include About Me, links to previous work, and contact info sections. I will continue to add to this Portfolio as my skills progress, and I have more application links. This was upgraded to utilize React.
